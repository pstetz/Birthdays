# Birthday reminder

author: Patrick Stetz ([Github](https://github.com/pstetz))

### Summary

This repo reminds me if someone's birthday is today!  Create your own `birthdays.csv` file to customize to yourself.

### Options

I'm thinking of different options to warn me of someone's birthday

- Automatically text person and say "Happy Birthday".  A risky move

- Talk to Finder and alert the user (preferred)

- Echo into Terminal

- Email me a reminder
